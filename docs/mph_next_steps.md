# Next Steps Action Plan

## Phase 1: Validation (Week 1)

### Real COMSOL Testing
- [ ] Test MPh implementation with actual COMSOL installation
- [ ] Validate all core modules work with real MPh library
- [ ] Fix any COMSOL-specific API differences
- [ ] Test both Fresnel and Kumar variants end-to-end

### Result Comparison
- [ ] Build identical models with old and new implementations
- [ ] Compare .mph file structure and content
- [ ] Validate temperature field results match
- [ ] Check time series data equivalence
- [ ] Document any differences found

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Benchmark build times: old vs new
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during model building
- [ ] Compare simulation solve times
- [ ] Identify any performance regressions

## Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Add MPh tests to GitHub Actions pipeline
- [ ] Create smoke tests for both implementations
- [ ] Add performance regression tests
- [ ] Update documentation build process

### Team Integration
- [ ] Code review session for MPh architecture
- [ ] Team training on new API patterns
- [ ] Create migration checklist for developers
- [ ] Set up feedback collection process

### Error Handling Refinement
- [ ] Test error scenarios with real COMSOL
- [ ] Improve error messages based on real usage
- [ ] Add retry logic for connection issues
- [ ] Enhance logging for debugging

## Phase 3: Production Deployment (Week 3)

### Feature Flag Implementation
- [ ] Add --use-mph flag to existing CLI
- [ ] Create configuration option for implementation choice
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout mechanism
- [ ] Add usage analytics to track adoption

### Documentation Finalization
- [ ] Update README with MPh option
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add API reference documentation
- [ ] Record demonstration videos

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add metrics for build success/failure rates

- [ ] Faster onboarding for new team members

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] >90% test coverage maintained
- [ ] <1% error rate in production
- [ ] Mean time to resolution for issues <4 hours
- [ ] Documentation completeness >95%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **COMSOL API Changes**: Pin MPh version, test compatibility
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking
- **Memory Issues**: Monitor and optimize resource usage
- **Integration Complexity**: Gradual rollout with fallback

### Process Risks
- **Team Resistance**: Training and gradual introduction
- **Migration Errors**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Support Burden**: Clear documentation and examples
- **Timeline Pressure**: Prioritize critical path items

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- [ ] Weekly progress reports during validation phase
- [ ] Demo sessions for management and users
- [ ] Regular team sync meetings
- [ ] Issue escalation procedures

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Keep migration plan updated with progress
- [ ] Document lessons learned and best practices
- [ ] Update project roadmap with timeline adjustments
- [ ] Maintain decision log for architectural choices
