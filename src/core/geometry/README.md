# Geometry Builders (Scaffold)

Future geometry creation utilities live here. The current geometry is defined
programmatically in `src/core/build.py` to match the COMSOL Java demo.

Guidelines:
- Keep defaults unchanged.
- Export small, composable helpers that can be adopted by the existing build
  flow without breaking changes.
