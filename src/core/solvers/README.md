# Solver Wrappers (Scaffold)

This package will provide thin wrappers for study/solution setup and advanced
solver orchestration. The current implementation remains embedded in
`src/core/build.py`.

Planned (optional):
- Time-stepping presets.
- Convergence/reporting hooks.
- Batch/sweep coordination.
